# RPS

I made a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game in Python. It was written in Python 2, but is formatted to work with Python 3 also.

## Versions

`RPS.py` is an actual game where the computer's choices are randomized.

`RPS_loaded.py` is a joke version where the computer will always choose a winning move.
